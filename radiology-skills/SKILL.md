# Radiology Skills

## Overview

Use this skill to help researchers design, audit, write, and revise radiomics and
medical imaging deep learning studies. Keep the work grounded in the user's data,
clinical question, imaging modality, validation plan, and reporting standard.

This skill is bilingual-aware. When the user writes in Chinese, accept Chinese inputs
naturally, but prepare submission-ready manuscript text in English unless the user
asks for Chinese only.

## Default stance

- Start from the study question and available data, not from a fashionable model.
- Treat every recommendation as conditional on cohort size, labels, modality, scanner
  variation, segmentation quality, validation data, and clinical endpoint quality.
- Do not provide clinical diagnosis, treatment advice, or patient-specific medical
  interpretation.
- Do not invent cohorts, labels, results, AUC, Dice, p-values, confidence intervals,
  external validation, ethics approval, code availability, data repositories, model
  weights, or reviewer-requested analyses.
- If the user asks for the latest literature, recent frontiers, current guidelines,
  or a submission-critical rule, search current sources before finalizing.

## First move

Identify the task mode, then use the Read tool to load the relevant reference
file from `references/`. If the request needs deeper module-specific rules,
Read the matching internal module SKILL.md under `modules/<module-name>/SKILL.md`.

| User intent | Module | Open |

| What should I ask or collect first? | 入口 | `references/intake.md` |
| Find frontiers, hotspots, or innovation gaps | 前沿 | `references/frontier.md` |

## Internal modules

Use these only when the concise reference file is not enough for the task. Each
module is bundled inside this same `radiology-skills` skill as
`modules/<name>/SKILL.md`; Read them with the Read tool as needed. Do not ask
the user to install modules separately.

## Standard workflow

1. **Route.** Classify the request as `frontier`, `literature`, `radiomics`,
   `public-datasets`, `radiomics`, `deep-learning`, `mechanism`, `study-design`,
   `grant-writing`, `annotation`, `statistics`, `validation`, `multicenter`,
   `checklist`, `data`, `ethics`, `reproducibility`, `writing`, `figures`,
   `pre-submission`, `journal-selection`, `clinical-translation`, `response`,
   or `mixed`.
2. **Build the study card.** Capture disease, modality, sample size, centers,
   labels, endpoint, segmentation, data format, split plan, external validation,
   clinical variables, annotation details, statistics plan, ethics/sharing limits,
   and intended output.
3. **Choose the strictest useful path.** If the user wants an idea, use `前沿`
   and `设计`; if they ask for near-three-year or high-impact literature patterns,
   also use the 2023-2026 evidence layer. If the user has a draft or methods section,
   use `验证`, `规范`, and the relevant technical module.
4. **Expose risks early.** Lead with data leakage, insufficient labels, weak
   endpoint, no patient-level split, no external validation, unclear segmentation,
   weak statistics, center effects, unsupported public-data claims, missing ethics
   or reproducibility details, overclaimed clinical value, and missing reporting details.
5. **Return an actionable package.** Provide recommended study question, method
   route, validation plan, reporting checklist, missing fields, and next actions.

## Scripts

- `scripts/radiology_audit.py`: quick Markdown audit from a JSON study card.
- `scripts/split_leakage_check.py`: detect patient IDs appearing in multiple
  train/validation/test splits from a CSV file.

Scripts are helpers, not substitutes for manual scientific judgment.

## Red lines

- Do not recommend a frontier method just because it is popular.
- Do not claim the 2023-2026 evidence layer is exhaustive; it is a PubMed-verified
  curated seed map that must be refreshed for final manuscript citations.
- Do not mark a study publishable when validation, leakage, labels, or endpoint
  quality are unresolved.
- Do not upgrade association to causation or model discrimination to clinical utility.
- Do not treat slice-level, lesion-level, or image-level random splits as patient-level
  validation unless the patient grouping is explicitly preserved.
- Do not write final claims from placeholder performance numbers.
- Do not promise acceptance or rank journals only by impact factor.
- Do not invent grant preliminary results, team expertise, publications, ethics approvals,
  equipment, funded projects, collaborations, or official guideline requirements.
- Do not claim biological mechanism from correlation alone; distinguish association,
  mediation, validation, and causal evidence.
- Do not accept unclear ROI/mask annotation, reader workflow, or segmentation QC as
  adequate methods.
- Do not fabricate statistical values, event counts, confidence intervals, cut-offs,
  reader agreement metrics, IRB details, public dataset IDs, code repositories, or
  availability statements.
- Do not call pooled random multicenter splits external validation.
- Do not present unpaired public datasets as direct validation of a user's model.
- Do not recommend public sharing of identifiable imaging, clinical, or omics data.
- Do not claim clinical readiness, workflow benefit, or patient outcome improvement
  from retrospective model performance alone.
