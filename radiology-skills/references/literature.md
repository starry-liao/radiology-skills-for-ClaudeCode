# 文献

Use this file when searching, screening, or organizing radiology AI literature.

## Search stance

Search for concepts, not only exact titles. Combine:

- disease: lung cancer, HCC, glioma, breast cancer, rectal cancer, stroke, etc.
- modality: CT, MRI, PET/CT, ultrasound, mammography, pathology, multimodal
- task: classification, segmentation, prognosis, response prediction, survival, radiogenomics
- method: radiomics, deep learning, transformer, foundation model, self-supervised,
  multimodal fusion, domain adaptation, calibration
- standard: CLAIM, CLEAR, RQS, IBSI, TRIPOD+AI, PROBAST+AI, STARD-AI, METRICS

## Source hierarchy

1. Primary research articles and official guideline papers.
2. Systematic reviews or scoping reviews for landscape mapping.
3. Publisher pages, PubMed, arXiv, and conference proceedings for discovery.
4. Secondary databases only as discovery aids.

## Screening tiers

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `direct` | Same disease, modality, task, and validation need |
| `method-transfer` | Different disease but method can transfer |
| `background` | Helps frame trend or clinical need |
| `weak` | Related keywords but not useful for the project |

## High-impact journal seed map

When a user asks for frontiers or a publishable topic, start with a current search, then
use this seed map to structure the synthesis. Verify details before citing in a final
manuscript because this list is a curated starting point, not an exhaustive review.

## Common mistakes

- Listing many papers without explaining how they change the study design.
- Treating arXiv performance as established clinical evidence.
- Ignoring negative, external-validation, or reproducibility papers.
- Using outdated guidelines when the user asks for current reporting standards.
- Equating "published in a high-impact journal" with suitability for the user's data.
